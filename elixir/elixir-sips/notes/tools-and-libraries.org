* Elixir Sips - Tools and Libraries

** Elixir Standard Library

*** Enum

- `Enum.all?` - Returns `true` when all items in the collection
  returns `true` for a provided *predicate*.
- `Enum.any?` - Returns `true` when any item in the collection
  returns `true` for a provided *predicate*.
- `Enum.at` - Returns an item from collection by zero-based index. If
  there is no such index, returns `nil`.
- `Enum.chunks` - Returns chunks of collection by specified size, step
  and padding.
- `Enum.chunks_by` - Starts a new chunk at each place that returns
  `true` for the provided *predicate*.
- `Enum.concat` - Concatenates list of lists into a single list. Also
  works with ranges.
- `Enum.count` - It returns number of items in the collection, but
  also with provided *predicate* it returns number of items that
  returns `true` when applied to it.
- `Enum.drop` - It drops the first `count` items in the collection.
- `Enum.drop_while` - It drops items in the beginning of the
  collection while *predicate* returns `true`.
- `Enum.each` - Invokes *predicate* for each element in the
  collection.
- `Enum.empty?` - Returns `true` when collection is empty.
- `Enum.fetch` - Returns tuple with atom `:ok` and element on the
  given index in the collection if exists, or `:error` when it does
  not. If you call it with `!` at the end, it raises an
  `OutOfBoundsError` (this version returns only value, not a tuple
  when succeeds).
- `Enum.filter` - It filters the collection, by a given *predicate*.
- `Enum.filter_map` - It filters and maps the value in the one
  pass. You have to specify two *funs*.
- `Enum.find` - It returns first item, which returns `true` from a
  given *predicate*. You can specify a default, instead of `nil`.
- `Enum.find_index` - As above, but it returns an index.
- `Enum.find_value` - As above, but it returns value returned from a
  provided *fun*.
- `Enum.first` - Returns first element from the collection or `nil` if
  the collection is empty.
- `Enum.flat_map` - Returns a modified collection, modification is
  performed by a *fun* provided in the invocation which has to return
  a collection.
- `Enum.join` - Joins a collection with a *joiner*. By default
  *joiner* is an empty binary.
- `Enum.map` - Maps a collection, each item in new collection is a
  result of provided *fun*.
- `Enum.map_join` - Maps and join collection at one pass. Defaults as
  above.
- `Enum.map_reduce` - Performs map-reduce on a collection in one
  pass. Provided *fun* should return a tuple which has in first
  element new mapped element and in second one updated accumulator.
- `Enum.max` - Maximum value from collection.
- `Enum.max_by` - Maximum value from collection transformed by a given
  *fun*.
- `Enum.min` - Minimum value from collection.
- `Enum.min_by` - Minimum value from collection transformed by a given
  *fun*.
- `Enum.member?` - Checks if a value is a member of collection.
- `Enum.partition` - Partitions a collection into two collections, one
  collection contain elements which returned *truthy* value by a given
  predicate, second one which returned *falsy* value.
- `Enum.reduce` - Reducer across collection by a given *fun*. First
  argument used as a starting value.
- `Enum.reject` - Rejects values which are return `true` for a given
  *predicate*.
- `Enum.reverse` - Reverses the collection.
- `Enum.shuffle` - Shuffles the collection.
- `Enum.slice` - Returns a subset list for a given collections. It
  expects an index and a size of subset.
- `Enum.sort` - Merge sort algorithm invoked on a collection. You can
  pass a *comparator fun*.
- `Enum.split` - Splits a collection in a given index, if index is
  negative it counts backwards
- `Enum.split_while` - Splits a collection into two while *predicate*
  returns `true`.
- `Enum.take` - Takes first `n` elements from a collection.
- `Enum.take_every` - It takes every element starting from the first
  incremented by a provided `step`.
- `Enum.take_while` - Takes first elements while *predicate* returns
  `true`.
- `Enum.to_list` - Converts collection to a list.
- `Enum.uniq` - Removes duplicated items.
- `Enum.with_index` - It returns collection where each element is a
  tuple which contains an actual value and index (beware of order in a
  tuple).
- `Enum.zip` - Zips together two collections, resulting collection is
  a list of tuples. If the second list is shorter, missing values are
  filled with `nil`.

*** Streams

- Lazy, composable enumerables.
  - `Stream.repeatedly(fn() -> 1 end) |> Enum.take(10)`
  - `Stream.repeatedly(&:random.uniform/0) |> Enum.take(10)`
  - `Stream.cycle([1,2,3]) |> Enum.take(10)`
  - Bigger example:
    ```
    file_stream = Stream.resource(fn -> File.open!("/usr/share/dict/words") end,
                                  fn(file) ->
                                    case IO.read(file, :line) do
                                      data when is_binary(data) -> {data, file}
                                      _ -> nil
                                    end
                                  end,
                                  fn(file) -> File.close(file) end)
    file_stream |> Stream.take_every(200) |> Enum.take(10)
    file_stream |> Stream.drop(2000) |> Stream.take(4) |> Enum.to_list |> Stream.cycle |> Enum.take(20)
    ```

*** Agent

- Simple abstraction around state.
  - Replacement for `gen_server` which only modifies the state.
  - [[../samples/agent_playground][Example usage]]

*** Task

- Simple abstraction for computing a value in the background and
  receiving the value asynchronously later.
  - [[../samples/website_pipeline][Example usage]]

** Erlang Standard Library

*** gs

- Deprecated *Erlang* graphics subsystem, replaces by *wx*.
  - It will be removed in incoming release - *18.0*.

*** xmerl

- Built-in *Erlang* module for parsing *XML*.
  - [[../samples/xml_parsing][Example usage]]

*** dbg

- Tracing functions, processes and messages in *Erlang* / *Elixir*.
  - Help methods - `:dbg.h`
  - List of actual traces - `:dbg.i`
  - Trace invocation - `:dbg.c(:"Elixir.Foo", :bar, [])`
  - Start tracer server - `:dbg.tracer`
    - Trace process interactions - `:dbg.p(pid, [:m, :procs])`

*** ssh

- Built-in module for interacting with SSH.
- OTP is shipped with an implementation of SSH daemon.
  - You can connect to it from the any authorized *Erlang* shell.
  - Interacting with *Elixir* code needs to be done in particular way,
    but it is pleasant and possible.

*** pg2

- A replacement for `pg` module that has better semantics for
  distribution.
  - `pg2` expands to *Process Group*.
  - [[../samples/string_processes][Example use case]]

** OTP

*OTP* is a *Open Telecom Platform*. Set of libraries for building
reliable and distributed systems.

*** gen_server

- Generic request/reply server implementation.
  - [[../samples/OTP/gen_server_playground][Example implementation with tests]]

*** gen_tcp

- Module with set of functions related with TCP connection handling
  and sockets.

*** Distribution

- `iex --name "foo@0.0.0.0"` - the same as adding name to the Erlang
  session.
  - `:erlang.register(:shell, self)` - registering the named process
    across the cluster.
  - For local sessions, you don't have to setup a *cookie* (it is
    already shared because of the file defined in your home
    directory).
    - For remote nodes you have to define the *identical cookie*, it
      is the only security mechanism built-in to the Erlang VM.
  - Joe Armstrong's favorite program:
    ```
    receive do
      {:become, some_fn} -> some_fn.()
    end
    ```

*** Port

- Interacting with external programs, as if they are acting as a
  simple process.
  - `Port.open({:spawn, "ls"}, [])`
    - You received result asynchronously, to your mailbox as a normal
      message from the different process.
  - Another example:
    ```
    port = Port.open(
      {:spawn, "bash --noediting -i"},
      [:stderr_to_stdout, :binary, :exit_status]
    )
    ```
    - Interacting:
      - `send(port, {self, {:command, "pwd\n"}})`
      - `send(port, {self, {:command, <<27>>}})`

    (*Disk Erlang Term Storage*).
  - [[../samples/ets_playground][Example use case for both]]

** IEx.pry

- Built-in inspection tool for running processes.
  - After invoking `IEx.pry` it will ask you to allow open a new
    session. After accepting that you will have access to the whole
