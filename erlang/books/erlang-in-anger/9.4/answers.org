* 9.4 Exercises
** Review Questions
*** 1. Why is debugger use generally limited on Erlang?
*** 2. What are the options you can use to trace OTP processes?
*** 3. What determines whether a given set of functions or processes get traced?
*** 4. How can you stop tracing with recon_trace? With other tools?
*** 5. How can you trace non-exported function calls?
** Open-ended Questions
*** 1. When would you want to move time stamping of traces to the VMâ€™s trace mechanisms directly? What would be a possible downside of doing this?
*** 2. Imagine that traffic sent out of a node does so over SSL, over a multi-tenant system. However, due to wanting to validate data sent (following a customer complain), you need to be able to inspect what was seen clear text. Can you think up a plan to be able to snoop in the data sent to their end through the ssl socket, without snooping on the data sent to any other customer?
** Hands-On
*** 1. Can chatty processes (council_member) message themselves? (hint: can this work with registered names? Do you need to check the chattiest process and see if it messages itself ?)
*** 2. Can you estimate the overall frequency at which messages are sent globally?
*** 3. Can you crash a node using any of the tracing tools? (hint: dbg makes it easier due to its greater flexibility)
