** Review Questions
*** 1. How can you choose where a crash dump will be generated?
    - By passing filename and path to `ERL_CRASH_DUMP` environment variable.
*** 2. What are common avenues to explore if the crash dump shows that the node ran out of memory?
    - Processes message queue length.
    - Particular sections of system memory allocated by VM (atom table, binaries
      etc.).
    - Low overall memory usage, but still can't allocate new piece - memory
      fragmentation.
    - Maximum number of application restarts.
    - Too many file descriptors opened.
*** 3. What should you look for if the process count is suspiciously low?
    - For memory piece related with VM system elements (like atom table, ETS,
      binaries etc.).
*** 4. If you find the node died with a process having a lot of memory, what could you do to find out which one it was?
    - You can use `recon's` script called `queue_fun.awk` for determining which
      one was running during the crash time.
** Hands-On
*** 1. What are specific outliers that could point to an issue?
    - A lot of messages gathered in one process.
    - A lot of memory allocated by one process.
    - A lot of TCP file descriptors opened.
*** 2. Does it look like repeated errors are the issue? If not, what could it be?
    - It can be an effect of overload or resource leak, because a lot of TCP
      connections are opened and are actually used.
